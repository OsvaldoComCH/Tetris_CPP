<h1>Welcome to Tetris_CPP</h1>
<p>
This is a passion project that I started in 2023 to get better at C++. I am a big fan of Tetris and wanted to make a version of the 
game to run on my computer. This could be an easy project if I didn't care about the quality of my game, but I wanted this to be a
perfect Tetris clone. Also, although there're many libraries and frameworks that could help, I wanted to do it with just the stardard
libraries, using the Windows API for rendering. All of this made this project a lot more difficult, but a lot more fun as well.
</p>
<p>
My final goal with the project is to have it mimic the original game perfectly, with some extra features that I might find useful, and
finally, create my own AI to play the game, preferably without external libraries. This is going to take a while, specially because I
am not fully focused on it at all times. But I will drop an update or a new release every now and then, when they're ready.
</p>
<p>
The main branch has the latest stable version that I managed to compile. Untested has things that I coded, but haven't tested, it's 
mainly for storing code that I made in computers other than my own, or features that aren't fully implemented.
I use Mingw-w64 to compile this code, the compiler command can be found in the top of the main.cpp file.
